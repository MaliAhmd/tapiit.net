            <div class="accordion-item-desc">It's worth noting that in our entry-level Metal cards are called Machine Pressed cards, it is possible to see the two materials stuck together at the edges. However, this does not affect the overall performance or durability of the card. We currently offer the Machine Pressed Metal cards in Black only.
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item-desc">For those looking for a more durable option, we offer CNC Reformed cards that feature a specialised design that covers the edges to prevent any visible seams. This makes them an ideal choice for those who demand the highest level of quality and craftsmanship.
